Idea: make a website where navigation is done entirely through keytrokes. There will be navigation stuff but all of it are unclickable. There will be a global typing bar where you click something to enable it or it's always on. You type in keywords and then enter to fire clickable actions. such as you type "home" and the site will redirect to homepage. Type in "about" and it will redirect to the about page. Type "down" and it will scroll down, type in "end" and it will scroll the very bottom. I can also add easter egg actions to have the site do stuff or secret windows will pop up or secret modals. Toggling light mode and dark mode is typing "light" or "dark".
